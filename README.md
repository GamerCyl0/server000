In your chosen IDE, create a new server.go file. Go to my server.go file located in this repository, copy the code, and then paste it into your file and run it. Navigate to: <hostname>:8080.

This Repository is part of a challenge given to me:
Create a server on port 8080 that serves a page of html.

For extra credit:
Link or redirect the web page to the code repository.
